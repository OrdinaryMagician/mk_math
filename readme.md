Remember to change the class prefix if you use them in your project.

The projection utility class obviously is meant to be used with the
[Gutamatics](https://gitlab.com/Gutawer/gzdoom-gutamatics/) library.

The relative axes returned by CoordUtil.GetAxes use left-hand coordinates by

to use right-handed Y if you want it.
