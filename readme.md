Remember to prefix the classes if you use them in your project.

Including the license file is optional, but recommended.

The quaternion class doesn't offer as much functionality as its equivalent in
[Gutamatics](https://gitlab.com/Gutawer/gzdoom-gutamatics/), but it should

The relative axes returned by CoordUtil.GetAxes use left-hand coordinates.
That is, positive Y means "to the right".
